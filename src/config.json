  "defaultText": "This is c-markdown-editor, the Concordant collaborative editor.  \n\nYou type into the left-hand panel, which displays the raw characters. The right-hand one displays formatted text.  \n\nThe usual Markdown conventions apply: # for titles, *for italics*, etc. Alternatively you can use the buttons at the top.  \n\nYou can download your document as a Markdown file, using the rightmost button.  \n\nIn the \"Document:\" box, name your document. Browsers using the same name share their edits through the Concordant platform. A document is persistent; however, we reset our storage server periodically to limit possible abuse.  \n\nPlease contact mailto:support@concordant.io with any issues.  \n\nKnown issues with this version include: poor interactive performance; no disconnected mode; limited awareness (remote cursors are not displayed)."
