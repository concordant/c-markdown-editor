Two browsers accessing the same document name will be sharing their edits through the Concordant platform. A document is persistent; however we reset the server periodically to limit possible abuse.\n\nThe usual Markdown conventions apply: # for titles, *for italics*, etc. Alternatively you can use the buttons at the top.\n\nYou can download your document as a Markdown file, using the rightmost button.\n\nPlease contact mailto:support@concordant.io with any issues.\n\nKnown issues with this version include: poor interactive performance; no support for disconnected mode; the local user is not aware of the cursors of remote users."
