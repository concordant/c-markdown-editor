# Status of C-Markdown Editor

16 March 2021

This is an alpha version of a collaborative text editor. Its aim is to provide an example of a collaborative application leveraging the Concordant vision. Features, performance, and user-friendliness have been secondary considerations.

## Limitations due to the editing engine

It is currently based upon the [react-md-editor](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-md-editor) text-editing engine, which has some limitations:

- It has separate input panel (left) and rendering panel (right), considered not user-friendly.
- It uses a sequential HTML model, where input comes from the user and computes output, which is not well adapted to the collaborative model with concurrent input streams.

In order to fix these limitations, we plan to replace it with a single-panel editing engine with an active DOM model, e.g., [crdt-md-editor](https://github.com/ilyasToumlilt/crdt-md-editor).

## Implementation-related limitations

This implementation uses the alpha version of the Concordant platform, and inherits from its limitations (documented in [Concordant client STATUS.md](https://github.com/concordant/c-client/blob/master/STATUS.md)). This leads to more limitations:

- Disconnected operation is not yet supported.

## Bugs

We are aware of the following bugs:

- Itâ€™s slow. There is excessive lag between typing a character and its rendering.
- When distant modifications are merged locally, a rendering of the UI component is triggered, and user's cursor is placed at the end of the document. This is not convenient if you are at the same moment editing.

We are working actively on fixing the bugs.
